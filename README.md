# ML-Techniques-for-MRI-Feature-Based-Detection-of-FTD


This repository has been created in order to share the methodological steps performed in Machine Learning Techniques for MRI Feature-Based Detection of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration.

Specifically, as clarified in the paper, we focused our attention on two alternative algorithms:

- SVM Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

All the other techniques we tested on the data are included in the Google Colab's notebook labeled AutoSKlearn_26_11.ipynb.

Both Python codes are available in the repository. The original dataset is not included, as it is proprietary of the Centre for Ageing
Brain and Neurodegenerative Disorders, University of Brescia (Brescia, Italy).
We used Python version 3.8.8, and the packages versions are specified in the requirements.txt file. 


The dataset used in this work can be requested to the Centre for Ageing Brain and Neurodegenerative Disorders (University of Brescia, Italy) for research purposes.
